The main objective of the R package `{pollspain}` is to provide social scientists, political analysts and citizens with easy and straightforward [**access to electoral data from Spain**]{.hl}. This includes both **aggregated election results** extracted from polling stations and **electoral survey data** (including housing effects). The package also offers tools for seat allocation, vote simulation, and visualization. The package is designed under [**tidyverse-style functions**]{.hl} specially tailored for beginners.

## Installation

You can [**install the development version**]{.hl} from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools") # only if not already installed
devtools::install_github("dadosdelaplace/pollspain")
library(pollspain) # after installing
```


```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
library(pollspain)
```

An **internet connection** is required for installing and downloading data. Data is stored in the accompanying `pollspain-data` repository. You can find **more information about the data structure** at <https://github.com/dadosdelaplace/pollspain-data>

## Usage

### Election summaries

Using `summary_election_data(type_elec = ..., year = ..., level = ...)` with

* a vector of **election dates** (e.g., `year = 2023` or `date = "2023-07-24"`)
* a vector of **election types** (currently, it only works properly for `type_elec = "congress"`)
* a geographic **level for aggregation** (e.g., `level = "ccaa"` or `level = "prov"`)

returns a [**summary table of election results aggregated at the administrative level**]{.hl}. This includes both general data (blank votes, turnout, etc) and the **ballots received by each party or candidacy**. The available [**aggregation levels**]{.hl} (`level`) are: `"all"` (for a national summary), `"ccaa"` (autonomous communities), `"prov"` (province), `"mun"` (municipality), `"mun_district"` (electoral district), `"sec"` (census section), and `"poll_station"`.

```{r summary-election-data-1, eval = FALSE}
# Summary election data at national level for both elections in 2019
# (general data without candidacies ballots)
summary_data_all <- summary_election_data(type_elec = "congress", year = 2019)
summary_data_all
```

```{r summary-election-data-1-b, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# Summary election data at national level for both elections in 2019
# (general data without candidacies ballots)
summary_data_all <- summary_election_data(type_elec = "congress", year = 2019)
knitr::kable(summary_data_all)
```

```{r summary-election-data-3, eval = FALSE}
# Summary election data, aggregating candidacies ballots at prov level
summary_data_prov_parties <-
  summary_election_data("congress", year = c(2000, 2008, 2023),
                        level = "prov", by_parties = TRUE)
head(summary_data_prov_parties, 5)
```

```{r summary-election-data-3-b, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# Summary election data, aggregating candidacies ballots at prov level
# for three elections
summary_data_prov_parties <-
  summary_election_data("congress", year = c(2000, 2008, 2023),
                        level = "prov", by_parties = TRUE)
knitr::kable(head(summary_data_prov_parties, 5))
```

`summary_election_data()` is a **user-friendly combination** of `get_election_data()` (which merges different data sources at the polling station level) and `aggregate_election_data()` (which aggregates the data to the requested level). See [**some uses and detailed input arguments**]{.hl} in [...](https://javieralvarezliebana.es/pollspain/articles/...), and [...](https://javieralvarezliebana.es/pollspain/articles/...) for  **advanced users**.

<summary>⚠️ About municipalities</summary>

The municipality data (names and codes) were **extracted from the version published by the National Statistics Institute (INE) on February 6, 2025**. The configuration of municipalities from previous years has been adapted to the most recent setup, recoding cases where municipalities have merged or disappeared.

Data extracted from <https://www.ine.es/daco/daco42/codmun/codmun20/20codmun.xlsx>

<summary>⚠️ About CERA</summary>

According to the National Statistics Institute (INE) «the electoral roll contains the registration of those who meet the requirements to be voters and are not definitively or temporarily deprived of the right to vote. The electoral roll is composed of:

* The electoral roll of Spanish citizens residing in Spain (CER).
* The **electoral roll of Spanish citizens residing abroad (CERA)**.

The electoral roll of residents in Spain who are nationals of countries with Agreements for municipal elections (CERE Agreements), and the electoral roll of citizens of the European Union residing in Spain for municipal and European Parliament elections (CERE EU)».

Los datos relativos a CERA se han agregado a nivel nacional, comunidad autónoma y provincial. ...

## Other functions

`{pollspain}` also provides [**more advanced users with useful functions**]{.hl} to preprocess and analyze electoral data—even their own data, as long as it is provided in a proper format.

* [**Utils**]{.hl}: functions contained in the `utils.R` script are intended to serve as **helper functions for data preprocessing**. See <https://javieralvarezliebana.es/pollspain/articles/utils.html> for [**more examples**](https://javieralvarezliebana.es/pollspain/articles/utils.html) about how to use them.

```{r}
type_to_code_election(type_elec = "congress")
extract_code("01-04-003-01-004-B", level = "mun")
extract_code("01-04-003-01-004-B", level = "mun", full_cod = TRUE)
```

* [**Import raw data**]{.hl}: functions starting with `import_..._data()` (code can be found in the `import_elections_data.R` file) are aimed at importing and preprocessing as raw as possible the `.DAT` election files from the Spanish Ministry of Interior files available in the [pollspain-data Github repository](https://github.com/dadosdelaplace/pollspain-data). See <...> for more examples about how to use them.
