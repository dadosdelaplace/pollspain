\title{Function to calculate the allocated seats according to the Hill
method in a given electoral district.}
\usage{
hill_seats(
  candidacies,
  ballots,
  blank_ballots,
  n_seats,
  threshold = 0.03,
  short_version = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{candidacies}{A vector containing one of the following
variable: unique codes or abbreviations of the candidacies
that participated in the election.}

\item{ballots}{A vector containing the absolute number of ballots
(integer positive values) received by each candidacies}

\item{blank_ballots}{A numerical value indicating the number of
blank ballots (integer positive values).}

\item{n_seats}{An integer positive value indicating the number of
seats that are going to distributed for a given electoral district.}

\item{threshold}{A numerical value (between 0 and 1) indicating the
minimal percentage of votes needed to obtain representation for a
given electoral district. Defaults to \code{0.03}.}

\item{short_version}{Flag to indicate whether it should be returned
a short version of the data (just key variables) or not. Defaults
to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A tibble or a list of tibbles  with rows corresponding to each party including the following
variables:
\item{candidacies}{abbrev or id of the candidacies}
\item{seats}{number of seats}
\item{ballots}{absolute number of ballots, just in long format}
\item{porc_seats}{percentage of seats respect to the number of seats,
just in long format}
\item{porc_ballots}{percentage of ballots respect to party ballots
(including blank ballots), just in long format}
\item{quotient_x}{intermediate quotients of the allocation process}
}
\description{
This function allocates seats to political parties in a given electoral district
using the Hill method (also known as the Equal Proportions method), a highest averages
approach for proportional representation. Each party's total number of votes is divided
by the square root of the product of the number of seats already allocated plus one and
that number itself (i.e., âˆšn(n+1)), producing a list of quotients. Seats are assigned
one at a time to the party with the highest quotient, repeating until all seats are allocated.
Only candidacies surpassing a specified threshold (as a proportion of total votes including blank votes)
are considered for allocation.
}
\details{
The purpose of this helper function is to be used in a general
function, \code{seats_allocation()}, to calculate the seats distribution of every
electoral district of a given election according to the Hill method.

\examples{

## Correct examples

## Seats distribution with Hill method for given vectors of candidacies and ballots
## without the remainder quotients

candidacies <- c("PP", "PSOE", "PODEMOS", "VOX")
ballots <- c(200, 350, 100, 200)

seats <- hill_seats(candidacies = candidacies, ballots = ballots,
 blank_ballots = 50, n_seats = 15, threshold = 0.03)

\dontrun{

# Incorrect examples

# Different length of candidacies and ballots

candidacies <- c("PP", "PSOE", "PODEMOS", "VOX")
ballots <- c(200, 350, 100)

seats <- hill_seats(candidacies = candidacies, ballots = ballots,
blank_ballots = 50, threshold = 0.03)
